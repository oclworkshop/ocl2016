### Lightning Talks (CfP) - 23/09/2016 

This year, the OCL workshop will host an open session at the end of the day where anybody will have the opportunity to talk about whatever they want for five minutes. No formal presubmission is required. Just send an email to [ocl16@easychair.org](ocl16@easychair.org) with the title and one paragraph description of what you'd like to talk about for organizational purposes.
 
As long as it's related to the topics of the workshop, you can talk about whatever you want: present a new tool, discuss early ideas, propose discussion topics, rant about OCL, etc. Our goal is to foster exchanges among the community that go beyond the formal presentation of the workshop papers. It's up to you to make this session exciting.

### Program Including Accepted Paper Preprints - 12/09/2016

The program of the workshop is now available, including a pre-proceeding PDF version of the accepted papers. You can download them [here](/2016/program.html).
